This is a readme provided by Thanaporn to describe things on data hierarchy I made

1. I want things to be like an outline (and as flexible as possible). 
So when more interfaces and classes will be added, but the existing codes should not change (much).

2. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to ask/email me. I won't bite.

3. My English is not excellent and my comment is poorly done. 
If you found an error and it's not in the comment (aka it's a piece of code or names), 
you probably want to inform the person responsible (tester or whoever)
so they can correct it without bombing everyone's codes.

Note: I'll try to get the hierarchy done by 11pm 10/30/2012. 
After that I'll try to make a visual hierarchy of things.
Everything should be done (v 0.1) by 11.59pm.
If not, I'll do until it's done.
